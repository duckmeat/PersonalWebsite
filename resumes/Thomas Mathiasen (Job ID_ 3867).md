### **Application for: Global Digital Data and Insight Lead (Job ID: 3867\)**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Global Digital Data and Insight Manager role. As a Marketing Technology Developer passionate about driving organizational change through data and automation, this position aligns perfectly with my hands-on experience in building and leveraging global data infrastructures to deliver actionable strategies.

The job description emphasizes the need to **build a global data foundation through taxonomy and tagging strategies**, which is a core part of my professional experience. In my "Data Layer Governance & Optimization" project, I re-architected a complex Tealium iQ implementation to improve data quality, governance, and consistency, directly matching your need for "data consistency across all markets and channels." My expertise in **Tealium iQ, Adobe Analytics, HTML & CSS, JavaScript** allows me to not only design these strategies but also execute them technically.

Furthermore, I have direct experience **driving the adoption of data protocols and feeding unified data streams**, as outlined in your responsibilities. My project "CDP and Server-Side Marketing Tracking" involved leveraging **Tealium AudienceStream (CDP)** and **API integrations (using Python and JavaScript)** to transition from client-side to server-side tracking. This created a more controlled, compliant, and reliable data collection foundation—precisely the kind of robust system needed to feed a centralized Global Data Lake.

My experience also translates directly to your need for **transforming complex datasets into clear recommendations and intuitive dashboards**. I am highly proficient in **Power BI** and **Adobe Analytics**, using them to build accessible reports that empower brand teams. More importantly, I have a strategic focus on **leading performance optimization**. My work establishing an "Organizational A/B Testing Framework" involved setting KPIs, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and analyzing results to guide decision-making and enhance ROI.

I am a data-driven strategist who thrives on turning numbers into narratives. I am confident that my technical skills in tag management and data integration, combined with my strategic experience in CRO and analytics, make me an ideal candidate to strengthen LEO Pharma's digital engagement intelligence capabilities.
